Project_CSC780
=================

This repository contains all the information about the android application/game Coincraver. We are developing this game as a part of mobile development course CSC 780 at San Francisco State University under Dr. Puder. Check out the "<b>design doucment in the wiki</b>" section to get the overview of our project.

<b>2D game in Android (help adding to it and that will be appreciated)</b>
<br></br>
A while ago, we have started programming a game for Android. Since we do not have enough time to finish it, we thought it would be better to publish the results so far. Everything is open source as you can see. We would like to see the improvements and added functionalities in our game and that is why we have decided to open source it.

<b>Used Things:</b><br></br>
-	Android
-	Java<br></br>
(No external library, but, we would encourage you to do so. <br></br>
Suggestion: Use AndEngine/Libgdx/Box2D. Google these ones and try to the render the activities)<br></br>
<br></br>
<b>Working now</b><br></br>
The player is behaving quite well but improvements can be made. Check the development guide here on Github that will walk you through the entire Coincraver game development process. <br></br><br></br>
<b>Spagetti code(We think so, what you think?)</b><br></br>
You are free to make improvements to the code structure too. We would recommend a cleaning because this was our first “game” project for Android.
<br></br>

<b>Tested on</b><br></br>
We have tested on Google Nexus 5. It should work well on most modern devices (if not, make it so, you have our code ☺)
<br></br>

<b>Source and Copyright</b><br></br>
Everything is on GitHub. Use the code in any way you think is best but please help make it better. If you make a change that is good then make sure to push it to the Github here. The goal of us posting this is to make the game better and closer to actually being on the market (for free)
<br></br><br></br>
And thanks to Dr. Puder at San Francisco State University for the helpful tutorials on Android. Without referring those, we could not have thought of developing a game, especially, the tutorials that made use of SurfaceView class in Android.
